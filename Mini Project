SELECT CustomerID,CompanyName,[Address],City, Region, PostalCode, Country FROM customers WHERE City= 'Paris' OR City = 'London';

1.2	List all products stored in bottles.
select * from products where QuantityPerUnit like '%bottle%';

1.3	Repeat question above, but add in the Supplier Name and Country.
SELECT Products.*, Suppliers.CompanyName, Suppliers.Country FROM Products INNER JOIN Suppliers ON Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.SupplierID 
WHERE QuantityPerUnit like '%bottle%'

1.4	Write an SQL Statement that shows how many products there are in each category. Include Category Name in result set and list the highest number first.
Select Categories.CategoryName, COUNT (ProductID) AS 'Number_of_Products' from Products 
inner join Categories ON Products.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID GROUP BY categories.CategoryName Order by Number_of_Products DESC

1.5	List all UK employees using concatenation to join their title of courtesy, first name and last name together. Also include their city of residence.
SELECT CONCAT (TitleOfCourtesy,' ',FirstName,' ',LastName) AS 'Employee' ,city from Employees

1.6	List Sales Totals for all Sales Regions (via the Territories table using 4 joins) with a Sales Total greater than 1,000,000. Use rounding or FORMAT to present the numbers. 
SELECT [Order Details].OrderID, [Order Details].UnitPrice * [Order Details].Quantity AS TOTAL, Employees.EmployeeID  From Orders 
Inner join [Order Details] on Orders.OrderID = [Order Details].OrderID  
Inner join Employees on Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
inner join EmployeeTerritories 

1.7	Count how many Orders have a Freight amount greater than 100.00 and either USA or UK as Ship Country.
SELECT Count (OrderID) AS 'Orders' from  Orders 
WHERE Freight > 100.00 AND (ShipCountry = 'USA' OR ShipCountry='UK')

1.8	Write an SQL Statement to identify the Order Number of the Order with the highest amount of discount applied to that order.
select TOP(1) [Order Details].OrderID, round(sum(UnitPrice*Quantity),2 )AS TotalPrice, ROUND (sum ((UnitPrice*Quantity)*Discount),2) AS Deducted FROM [Order Details]
GROUP BY OrderID Order by Deducted DESC


Exercise 2 – Create Spartans Table (20 marks – 10 each)
2.1 Write the correct SQL statement to create the following table:

INSERT INTO Spartans_table
(
 Title,First_Name,Last_Name,University,Course,Qualification
)

VALUES

('Mr','Shaqil','Abdullah','Brunel','Mechanical Engineering','2:1'),

Exercise 3 – Northwind Data Analysis linked to Excel 

3.1 List all Employees from the Employees table and who they report to. No Excel required.
USE Northwind;
Select A.EmployeeID , A.FirstName + '  '+ A.LastName AS 'Employee', B.Firstname +'   ' + B.LastName AS 'Reports to' FROM Employees A
Left join Employees B ON A.ReportsTo = B.EmployeeID;

3.2 List all Suppliers with total sales over $10,000 in the Order Details table. Include the Company Name from the Suppliers 

3.3 List the Top 10 Customers YTD for the latest year in the Orders file. Based on total value of orders shipped. No Excel required.

SELECT top  
	CustomerID AS "Customer";
	Round(sum (UnitPrice * Quantity) * (1 - Discount), 2) AS " TOTAL SALES"
From Orders o
Join [ Order Details] od
	On o.OrderID = od.OrderID
Group by CustomerID, OrderDate
Having YEAR (OrderDate) = 1998
Order by "TOTAL SALES";

3.4 Plot the Average Ship Time by month for all data in the Orders Table using a line chart as below. 
Select concat(month ( OrderDate), '', YEAR (OrderDate)) 'Order date' , AVG (DATEDIFF (DAY, OrderDate, ShippedDate)) 'AVG shipping time'
from Orders
Group by concat(month ( OrderDate), '', YEAR (OrderDate));
